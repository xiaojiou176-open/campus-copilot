# Current View Triage

This skill is the compact read-only triage card for CampusCopilot.

It is designed to work like a lightweight plugin bundle:

- one skill prompt that tells the agent what job to do
- one install/config pack that tells the operator how to connect the runtime
- one capability map that explains which CampusCopilot tools are exposed
- one demo path that shows the shortest first-success flow
- one troubleshooting page that explains where the first failures usually live
- one manifest so the folder can travel into review-driven skill registries

Use it when you want the shortest truthful answer to:

- what should the student do first right now
